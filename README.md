### The purpose of this website:
Providing all people around the world with access to educational courses in many fields, and the ability to follow their progress during these courses.

### About this site:
*SINAU* is a website for courses, which contains many courses in different fields, and is available to anyone, anywhere!

The site starts from the *Sign In* page. You must create an account for you on this site.
After logging in, you will go to the *Home* page, where you will see your progress in the current courses, and get some suggestions for other courses.

Then we have an *Explore* page, from which you can search for the course you want, or search in the different categories.

We also have a page for the courses you registered, where you can view which courses you have currently or have already completed. When you click on one of the courses, you will go to the page for that course, where you can view the lessons, follow your progress and discuss anything relevant.

In the end we have your personal *Account* page, where you can view your data, control settings and get support.
